# C++ Learning Modules

This repository contains a series of modules designed to deepen your understanding of C++ concepts, focusing on the unique aspects of the language compared to C, and advancing through various Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles.

## Modules Overview

### Module 1: Introduction to C++ and OOP
This first module provides an introduction to C++ and highlights its differences from C. It serves as a gateway to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles, setting the foundation for more advanced concepts. Here, you'll start exploring:
- Basic C++ syntax and language constructs
- Core OOP principles and how they differ from procedural programming in C

### Module 2: Memory Management and Control Structures
This module focuses on memory management and control structures in C++. Topics covered include:
- Memory allocation in C++ using references and pointers to members
- Efficient memory handling practices and deallocation
- Advanced use of control structures like the `switch` statement

### Module 3: Polymorphism and Canonical Classes
In this module, you'll learn about ad-hoc polymorphism, function overloading, and the structure of canonical classes. The module aims to build understanding in:
- Ad-hoc polymorphism and method overloads
- The structure and purpose of orthodox canonical classes in C++
- Consistent patterns for creating and using classes

### Module 4: Inheritance in C++
This module dives into the inheritance feature of C++, allowing you to extend and reuse code effectively. Key concepts include:
- Types of inheritance in C++ (single, multiple, hierarchical, etc.)
- Practical uses and design considerations for inheritance in OOP
- Implementation of base and derived classes for modularity and scalability

### Module 5: Advanced Polymorphism, Abstract Classes, and Interfaces
The final module focuses on advanced OOP concepts, including subtype polymorphism and abstract classes. Topics covered include:
- Subtype polymorphism and dynamic dispatch
- Designing abstract classes and implementing interfaces
- Best practices for designing flexible and reusable interfaces

## Getting Started

Each module contains example code, exercises, and explanations to guide you through the core concepts. Clone the repository and navigate to each module's directory to start learning.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Amdouyah/cpp00-04.git
cd cpp00-04
